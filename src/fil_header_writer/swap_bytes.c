	some useful routines written by Jeff Hagen for swapping
	bytes of data between Big Endian and  Little Endian formats:

Big Endian - most significant byte in the lowest memory address, which
is the address of the data.  

Since TCP defines the byte ordering for network data, end-nodes must
call a processor-specific convert utility (which would do nothing if
the machine's native byte-ordering is the same as TCP's) that acts on
the TCP and IP header information only. In a TCP/IP packet, the first
transmitted data is the most significant byte.

Most UNIXes (for example, all System V) and the Internet are Big
Endian. Motorola 680x0 microprocessors (and therefore Macintoshes),
Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC, and Sun SuperSPARC processors are Big
Endian. The Silicon Graphics MIPS and IBM/Motorola PowerPC processors
are both Little and Big Endian (bi-endian).

Little Endian - least significant byte in the lowest-memory address,
which is the address of the data. 

The Intel 80X86 and Pentium and DEC Alpha RISC processors are Little Endian. 
Windows NT and OSF/1 are Little Endian. 
Little Endian is the less common UNIX implementation. 

The term is used because of an analogy with the story Gulliver's
Travels, in which Jonathan Swift imagined a never-ending fight between
the kingdoms of the Big-Endians and the Little-Endians, whose only
difference is in where they crack open a hard-boiled egg.
